## 📂 Dataset Contents
This project features five interconnected tables with rich, semi-messy, realistic data:

| Table Name               | Description                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `employees`              | Master employee list with magical details & performance |
| `training_certifications`| Magical training & skill certifications per employee   |
| `magical_work_survey`    | Employee sentiment, morale, and engagement levels      |
| `exit_interviews`        | Reasons for employee departures & recommendations      |
| `promotions`             | Internal promotions and advancement records            |

📄 Each table is described in detail in the [📘 HR Data Documentation](https://github.com/ShanePrairie/spell-scroll-hr-analytics/blob/main/HR_Data_Documentation.pdf).
